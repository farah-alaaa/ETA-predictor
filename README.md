# ETA-Predictor ðŸ•’ðŸšš

A machine learning web application that predicts **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)** for Amazon package deliveries based on real delivery data. This project combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model deployment using a trained regression model.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict delivery time (in hours) for packages using historical delivery data.
- **Model:** Trained using scikit-learn regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression).
- **Deployment:** Flask web app for interactive ETA predictions.
- **Dataset:** Includes features like order date, shipping date, location, and delivery service type.
